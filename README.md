# R-Shiny
### Purpose and theme of the application ✨
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize cinematographic data and to create a Shiny application allowing the user to explore the data with the greatest possible comfort.
### What does it look like? 🧐
The application is composed of 4 pages: GRAPHS, DATATABLE, SUGGESTION and CONTRIBUTORS.
- Page 1 (GRAPHS): contains a graphic visualization 📊 of the number and proportion of movies produced by genre and by decade, a table containing the 10 best-rated films by genre and then a slider to filter on the number of films according to the duration in minutes.
- Page 2 (DATATABLE): initially contains a graph sensitive to a brush maneuver and shows the correlation between the duration 🕓 and average vote variables. All you need is to select a box or field on the chart and all the observations that are in that field are then displayed in a table below the plot. It is a means for the user to select the observations of interest. There are too many observations in this data set and therefore too many points in the graph. However, it is possible to filter the observations using the “Search” option at the top right of the table. It is also possible to select the number of observations you want to display in the table using the “Show entries” block at the top left of the table. Then you can download the csv data file by clicking “Download Table” in the lower left corner.
- Page 3 (SUGGESTION): embedded video from youtube, contains a suggestion of top 20 movies of 2021 so far🥇.
- Page 4 (CONTRIBUTORS): brief description and contact of the developers 👩🏻‍💻 of the application. NOTA: I removed this page from the code for confidential reasons.
